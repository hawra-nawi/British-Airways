## British Airways Data Science Project

This repository contains the work completed as part of the British Airways Data Science virtual experience program offered by Forage.

### Project Overview

The project focuses on leveraging data science and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and gain insights into customer sentiment and preferences for British Airways.

### Key Components

1. **Web Scraping**: Utilized Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape customer reviews from Skytrax.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared unstructured text data for analysis.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Applied VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to categorize reviews as positive or negative.

4. **Topic Modeling**: Implemented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key themes in customer feedback.

5. **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations to present findings effectively.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Gensim, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Project Outcomes

- Identified prevalent topics in customer reviews
- Analyzed sentiment distribution across reviews
- Provided actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction

### Repository Structure

- `web_scraping.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing web scraping code
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Notebook with sentiment analysis implementation
